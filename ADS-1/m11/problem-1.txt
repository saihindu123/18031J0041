Here the pivot element is the starting element and if(i>pi&&j<pi) then swap i and j values and i and j exceedes/cross then we swap j with pivot.

Step1:Consider E has pivot element and i will be the Pivot next element i.e A and j will be the last element, we need to check whether i>pi&&j<pi and we need to swap.
    here j cross i so swap pi and j.So swap E and A
    E A S Y Q U E S T I O N
    A E S Y Q U E S T I O N

Step2: S is the pivot element.i is =Y and j=N. swap Y and N 

     A E S N Q U E S T I O Y

Step3: S is the pivot element.i is =U and j=O. swap U and O

       A E S N Q O E S T I U Y

Step4:  S is the pivot element.i is =T and j=I. swap T and I

        A E S N Q O E S I T U Y

Step5:  S is the pivot element.i is =T and j=I. Here j cross i so  swap S and I

        A E I N Q O E S S T U Y

Step6:  I is the pivot element.i is =N and j=E.swap N and E

        A E I E Q O N S S T U Y

Step7:  I is the pivot element.i is =Q and j=E.So j>i,swap I and E

        A E E I Q O N S S T U Y

Step8:  Q is the pivot element.i is =S and j=N.So j>i,swap Q and N

        A E E I N O Q S S T U Y

 After sorting the sequence is  A E E I N O Q S S T U Y
