Learining by doing-1

Suppose that the sequence P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E (where a letter means 
insert and an asterisk means remove the maximum) is applied to an initially empty priority queue. 
Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations.

Answers:

Insert: P R I O
After doing heapify
Then the maximum element will be at root so R is the maximum and the order is R P I O
Remove: R

Now P I O and Insert: R
Then P I O R
Then after heapify R P O I maximum element is R
Remove:R

Now the sequence is P O I
Remove: P

Now the sequence is O I
Insert I we get O I I and after heapify we get O I I 
Remove:O

Now the sequence is I I 
Insert: T we get I I T and after heapify we get T I I
Remove:T

Now the sequence is I I 
Insert: Y we get I I Y and after heapify we get Y I I
Remove:Y

Now the sequence is I I 
Remove:I

Now the sequence is I 
Remove:I

Insert:Q U E
After heapify we get U Q E
Remove:U

Now thw sequence is Q E
Remove:Q

Now the sequence is E
Remove:E

Insert U
Remove:U

Insert E

After remove the maximum operations.
R R P O T Y I I U Q U E

E is left
