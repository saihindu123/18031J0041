Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort?
answer:

time complexity of basic selection sort for an array in reverse order is O(n^2).
time complexity of basic insertion sort for an array in reverse order is O(n^2).
both methods runs for same time.
